**Author:** Samuel Moses Orokpo

## ** Overview**
RoLA (**Real-time Online Lightweight Anomaly Detection**) is a multivariate anomaly detection system for time-series data. It is designed for **real-time applications** in **safety-critical systems**, such as industrial monitoring, healthcare, and cybersecurity.

The system utilizes:
- **LSTM-based anomaly detectors (LADs)**
- **Dynamic thresholding for anomaly detection**
- **Correlation-based anomaly confirmation**
- **Performance evaluation with ground truth labels**

---

## ** 1Ô∏è‚É£ Installation**
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

---

## ** 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Preparation**
### ** Merging Process**
The dataset was created by merging multiple sensor readings over time. The following datasets were used:
- `C3_Temperature_10-28_10-30.csv`
- `C3_Turbidity_10-28_10-30.csv`
- `Flow_Flow_10-28_10-30.csv`
- `Flow_Temperature_10-28_10-30.csv`
- `Optode_Concentration10-28_10-30.csv`
- `Optode_Saturation_10-28_10-30.csv`
- `Optode_Temperature_10-28_10-30.csv`
- `SEB45_Conductivity_10-28_10-30.csv`
- `SEB45_Salinity_10-28_10-30.csv`

These datasets were merged using their common **timestamp** to create a structured dataset containing:
- **Temperature**
- **Turbidity**
- **Flow Rate**
- **Conductivity**
- **Salinity**
- **Oxygen Concentration**
- **Saturation levels**

### ** Preprocessing Steps**
- **Handled missing values** using:
  - Forward-fill (`ffill`)
  - Backward-fill (`bfill`)
  - Linear interpolation (`interpolate`)
- **Normalized numerical values** using **Min-Max Scaling**
- **Generated `Anomaly_Label` column** using the `3œÉ rule` (Z-score thresholding):
  - Data points **exceeding 3 standard deviations** were labeled as anomalies (`1`), while others remained normal (`0`).

## ** 3Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Model**
Ensure the dataset **`Labeled_Dataset_with_Anomaly_Labels.csv`** is in the same directory as the script.

Run the following command:
```bash
python rola_implementation.py
```
This will:
‚úÖ Load the dataset  
‚úÖ Apply real-time anomaly detection  
‚úÖ Compute and display evaluation metrics  

---

## ** 4Ô∏è‚É£ Configuration Parameters**
Modify these settings inside `CONFIG` in the script:
```python
CONFIG = {
    "LOOKBACK": 10,  # LSTM input window size
    "HIDDEN_UNITS": 10,
    "LEARNING_RATE": 0.005,
    "EPOCHS": 10,  
    "BATCH_SIZE": 1,
    "SLIDING_WINDOW_SIZE": 1000,  
    "CORREL_THRESHOLD": 0.90,  
}
```
- **LOOKBACK:** Number of previous time steps the LSTM considers  
- **SLIDING_WINDOW_SIZE:** The number of recent samples used for dynamic thresholding  
- **CORREL_THRESHOLD:** The minimum correlation required for anomaly confirmation  

---

## ** 5Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the Output**
The script prints detected anomalies and final evaluation metrics:
```bash
üîç Anomaly detected at index 102: [False, False, True, False, False]
üìù Evaluation Metrics:
‚úÖ TP: 71, FP: 168, FN: 38
‚úÖ Precision: 0.297, Recall: 0.651, F1-score: 0.408
‚úÖ Avg Inference Time: 0.619s, Std Dev: 0.043s
```

---

## ** 6Ô∏è‚É£ Key Enhancements**
 **Extended Lookback Window (5 ‚Üí 10) for better pattern detection**  
 **Stricter thresholding (`3œÉ ‚Üí 3.5œÉ`) to reduce false positives**  
 **Correlation-based anomaly confirmation for better robustness**  
 **Improved recall (0.651) while keeping inference time <1s**  

---

## ** 7Ô∏è‚É£ Future Work**
The following improvements are planned:
‚úÖ **Hybrid Model (LSTM + Isolation Forest) to reduce false positives**  
‚úÖ **Dynamic threshold tuning based on rolling mean trends**  
‚úÖ **Testing on a larger dataset for improved generalization**
